This is a small utility to test Qt's handling of font weight and styles, and it's ability to restore the exact font that was selected.

Two buttons allow to call up a font selection dialog: the upper button preselects the current font by handing the actual QFont to the font dialog. The lower button preselects using a clone of the current font, created from the family name, (integer) weight and the italic flag (a boolean). The upper button should always restore the correct font; the lower button should too, but is likely to fail for less common weights/styles or when the current locale isn't English.

After selecting a font, the display is updated and the selection is saved in the application settings, either as a native QFont or else using the string representation that is also shown to the right of the upper button.
This setting is read during application startup, which allows to test whether the selected font is restored correctly from a settings file.

The patches subdirectory hold my font weight improvement changes for various Qt versions.
